 * The sort() method sorts the items of an array.
 * By default, the sort() method sorts the values as strings in alphabetical and ascending order.
 * if numbers are sorted as strings, "25" is bigger than "100", because "2" is bigger than "1".
 * You can fix this by providing a "compare function" as parameter.
 *
 * Return Value: The Array object, with the items sorted
 * NoteðŸ–¤ This method changes the original array.

 than, so put these two numbers in our list: [${a},${b}]
  you'd start by comparing the first two numbers:
 * Is 100 greater than or less than 25? Less than, so put these two numbers in our list: 1,5
 * Is 3.14 greater than or less than 1? Greater than, so it goes after 1 in the new list
 * Is 3.14 greater than or less than 5 in our new list? Less than, so it goes before 5. Our new list is now [1,3.14,5]

 * Compare Function:
   Function used to determine the order of the elements.
   return a :

   * zero - if they're equal
   * positive value - otherwise.
   If omitted, the elements are sorted in ascending,
   ASCII character order.
