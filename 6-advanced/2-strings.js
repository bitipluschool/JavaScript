// Strings Can be Objects
/**
 * Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals:
let firstName = "Orel";
*/

/**
String Methods and Properties
Primitive values, like "Orel Hassid", cannot have properties or methods (because they are not objects).

But with JavaScript, methods and properties are also available to primitive values, 
because JavaScript treats primitive values as objects when executing methods and properties.
