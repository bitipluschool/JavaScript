/**
 * Hoisting is the process of moving functions declarations to the top of the file in runtime
 * Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.
 * a variable can be used before it has been declared.
 * To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.
 * Since this is how JavaScript interprets the code, it is always a good rule.
